# Flappy Bird

A tiny Flappy Bird-like clone built for the Mini JS Games Hub.

- Press P or click the Pause button to pause/resume.
- Start/Restart button resets the game.

Accessibility

- Canvas is focusable (tabindex) and accepts keyboard controls.
- Buttons have ARIA labels and the pause button has `aria-pressed` state.

Notes
