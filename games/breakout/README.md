# Breakout

A simple HTML5 Breakout (brick breaker) game added to the mini-js-games-hub.

Files:
- `index.html` — game page
- `script.js` — game logic and loop
- `style.css` — minimal styling

How to play:
- Open `games/breakout/index.html` in a browser.
- Use left/right arrow keys or move your mouse to control the paddle.
- Click Start to begin or restart the game.

Notes:
- Small, self-contained; no build step required.
- Feel free to tweak brick layout, speeds, and visuals in `script.js` and `style.css`.
